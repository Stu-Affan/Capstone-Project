# Capstone-Project
This project explores how automation can enhance medical diagnostics by focusing on early detection and severity assessment of common skin conditions. Using image processing and machine learning, it serves as a decision-support tool, improving accuracy, accessibility, and reducing the burden on specialists.
Bridging healthcare gaps with AI-driven dermatology support.

# AI-Powered Dermatology Assistant
Early detection made smarter.
This project offers a new perspective on how automation and AI can transform medical diagnostics. By combining advanced image processing and machine learning, the system identifies common skin conditions and evaluates their severity, empowering healthcare providers to deliver faster and more reliable decisions.

# Why it matters

* Global challenge: Millions suffer from skin diseases, but access to dermatology specialists is limited.

* Our solution: This assistant accelerates early detection, reducing delays in treatment.

* Supportive, not substitutive: Designed as a decision-support tool, augmenting dermatologists rather than replacing them.

* Transparent AI: Provides confidence scores and visual explanations for trust in predictions.

* Accessible anywhere: Available via web and mobile to extend reach into underserved communities.


# Tech Stack Highlights

* AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV
* Backend: Flask / FastAPI
* Frontend: React, Flutter
* Cloud: AWS / Google Cloud for deployment

# The Vision

Our vision is to make dermatological care more inclusive, transparent, and accessible â€” bridging the gap between urban hospitals and rural communities to ensure better outcomes everywhere.
